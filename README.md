### Augmented reality is FUN ###

This is a fork of GART toolkit available on [Codeplex](http://gart.codeplex.com) where it's released under MS-LPL license. See license folder for more details.

The AR.ForFun (name inspired by Coding4Fun toolkit) is a GART modification to incorporate Nokia Imaging SDK and real-time filtering on the camera view.

It has been tested on Nokia Lumia 920 device and works *awesome*!

This repo includes both the modified GART and the sample project to demonstrate how it works.

Enjoy and have **fun**!
